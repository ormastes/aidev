Feature: Coverage Analyzer System
  As a system tester
  I want to validate coverage analyzer system
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should load coverage data from file system
    Given I perform analyze on coverageAnalyzer
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should load coverage data from file system
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
      | 1 | I perform analyze on coverageAnalyzer | Action completes successfully |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle missing coverage file gracefully
    Given I perform analyze on coverageAnalyzer
    Then the operation should complete successfully
