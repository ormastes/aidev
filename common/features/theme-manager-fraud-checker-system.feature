Feature: Theme Manager Fraud Checker System
  As a system tester
  I want to validate theme manager fraud checker system
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should load theme configuration from file system
    Given I perform getCriteria on themeManager
    Then prodCriteria.coverage.class.minimum should be 95
    And prodCriteria.coverage.class.target should be 98
    And prodCriteria.duplication.maxPercentage should be 5
    And prodCriteria.fraudCheck.enabled should be true
    And prodCriteria.fraudCheck.minScore should be 95
    And demoCriteria.coverage.class.minimum should be 75
    And demoCriteria.coverage.class.target should be 80
    And demoCriteria.duplication.maxPercentage should be 20
    And demoCriteria.fraudCheck.minScore should be 75
