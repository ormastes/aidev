Feature: Duplication Detector System
  As a system tester
  I want to validate duplication detector system
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should collect TypeScript and JavaScript files from src directory
    Given I perform detect on duplicationDetector
    Then Array.isArray(metrics.duplicatedBlocks) should be true

  Scenario: Manual validation of should collect TypeScript and JavaScript files from src directory
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
      | 1 | I perform detect on duplicationDetector | Action completes successfully |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
      | Array.isArray(metrics.duplicatedBlocks) should be true | Pass |
