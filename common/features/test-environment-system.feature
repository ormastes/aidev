Feature: Test Environment System
  As a system tester
  I want to validate test environment system
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should load config
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should load config
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should load settings
    Then the operation should complete successfully
