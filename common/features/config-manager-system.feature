Feature: Config Manager System
  As a system tester
  I want to validate config manager system
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should load configuration from file system
    Then configManager.getThemes() should contain aidev-portal
    And configManager.getThemes() should contain chat-space
    And configManager.getThemes() should contain cli-framework

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should load configuration from file system
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
      | configManager.getThemes() should contain aidev-portal | Pass |
      | configManager.getThemes() should contain chat-space | Pass |

    Then themePort should be 3001
    And epicPort should be 3101
    And demoPort should be 3201
    And releasePort should be 8001
    And uniquePorts.size should be allPorts.length
