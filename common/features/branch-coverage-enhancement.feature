Feature: Branch Coverage Enhancement
  As a system tester
  I want to validate branch coverage enhancement
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should cover all branches in isPortAvailable method
    Then configManager.isPortAvailable(3001) should be false
    And configManager.isPortAvailable(3050) should be true
    And configManager.isPortAvailable(2000) should be false
    And configManager.isPortAvailable(9000) should be false
    And configManager.isPortAvailable(3000) should be true
    And configManager.isPortAvailable(3099) should be true

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should cover all branches in isPortAvailable method
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
      | configManager.isPortAvailable(3001) should be false | Pass |
      | configManager.isPortAvailable(3050) should be true | Pass |
