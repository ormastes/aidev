Feature: Report Generator System
  As a system tester
  I want to validate report generator system
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should generate valid report with complete data
    Given I perform generate on reportGenerator
    Then result should equal validReportData

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should generate valid report with complete data
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
      | 1 | I perform generate on reportGenerator | Action completes successfully |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
      | result should equal validReportData | Pass |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should reject invalid report data with missing required fields
    Then the operation should complete successfully
