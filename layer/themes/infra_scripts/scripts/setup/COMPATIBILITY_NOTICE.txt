================================
SETUP SCRIPTS MIGRATION COMPLETE
================================

The old Python-based setup scripts have been replaced with a new Node.js CLI.

If you have scripts or documentation that reference the old commands,
please update them to use:

  ./setup_folder.sh [command] [options]

For a full command reference, see:
- The backup directory (setup_backup_*)
- The new README.md in this directory
- src/layer/themes/setup-folder/README.md

Need the old scripts? Check your backup directory.
