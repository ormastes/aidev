Feature: Code Duplication Detection System
  As a code quality engineer
  I want to detect and analyze code duplication
  So that I can maintain clean and maintainable code

  Background:
    Given a duplication detection environment
    And source code files for analysis

  Scenario: Detect exact code duplication
    Given source files with identical code blocks
    When I run duplication detection
    Then exact duplicates should be identified
    And duplication percentage should be calculated
    And duplicate locations should be reported
    And suggestions for refactoring should be provided

  Scenario: Detect near-duplicate code blocks
    Given source files with similar code structures
    And minor variations in implementation
    When I run similarity-based duplication detection
    Then near-duplicates should be identified
    And similarity scores should be calculated
    And potential consolidation opportunities should be highlighted

  Scenario: Analyze function-level duplication
    Given source files with duplicate functions
    When I analyze function-level duplication
    Then duplicate functions should be identified
    And function signatures should be compared
    And refactoring opportunities should be suggested
    And impact analysis should be provided

  Scenario: Detect structural duplication patterns
    Given source files with similar structural patterns
    When I analyze structural duplication
    Then common patterns should be identified
    And pattern frequencies should be calculated
    And abstraction opportunities should be suggested

  Scenario: Handle cross-file duplication detection
    Given multiple source files
    And duplication across file boundaries
    When I run cross-file duplication analysis
    Then duplicates spanning multiple files should be detected
    And cross-references should be tracked
    And consolidation strategies should be recommended

  Scenario: Analyze duplication in different languages
    Given source files in multiple programming languages
    When I run language-aware duplication detection
    Then language-specific patterns should be recognized
    And language-appropriate analysis should be applied
    And cross-language similarities should be identified where applicable

  Scenario: Generate duplication metrics and reports
    Given duplication analysis results
    When I generate duplication reports
    Then overall duplication percentage should be calculated
    And duplication hotspots should be identified
    And trend analysis should be provided
    And actionable recommendations should be included

  Scenario: Set duplication thresholds and validation
    Given duplication threshold requirements
    When I validate code against thresholds
    Then duplication levels should be compared to thresholds
    And violations should be reported
    And severity levels should be assigned
    And compliance status should be determined

  Scenario: Exclude legitimate duplication patterns
    Given configuration for acceptable duplication
    And patterns that should be excluded from analysis
    When I run duplication detection with exclusions
    Then legitimate duplicates should be ignored
    And only problematic duplication should be reported
    And exclusion rules should be documented

  Scenario: Track duplication trends over time
    Given historical duplication data
    When I analyze duplication trends
    Then duplication changes over time should be tracked
    And improvement or degradation trends should be identified
    And predictive analysis should be provided
    And alerts should be generated for significant changes

  Scenario: Integrate duplication detection with CI/CD
    Given a CI/CD pipeline
    When duplication detection is integrated
    Then duplication checks should run automatically
    And build failures should occur for excessive duplication
    And reports should be generated for each build
    And trends should be tracked across builds

  Scenario: Provide duplication refactoring guidance
    Given identified code duplication
    When I request refactoring guidance
    Then specific refactoring strategies should be suggested
    And code examples should be provided
    And risk assessment should be included
    And step-by-step guidance should be available
