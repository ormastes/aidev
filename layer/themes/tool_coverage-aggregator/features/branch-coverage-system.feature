Feature: Branch Coverage Analysis System
  As a quality engineer
  I want to analyze branch coverage comprehensively
  So that I can ensure all code paths are tested

  Background:
    Given a coverage analysis environment
    And branch coverage data is available

  Scenario: Analyze basic branch coverage
    Given source code with simple if-else statements
    And test execution data
    When I analyze branch coverage
    Then both true and false branches should be tracked
    And coverage percentage should be calculated correctly
    And uncovered branches should be identified

  Scenario: Handle complex conditional statements
    Given source code with nested conditionals
    And multiple logical operators
    When I analyze branch coverage
    Then all conditional branches should be tracked
    And short-circuit evaluation should be considered
    And coverage should account for all logical paths

  Scenario: Analyze switch statement coverage
    Given source code with switch statements
    And various case scenarios
    When I analyze branch coverage
    Then each case should be tracked separately
    And default cases should be included
    And fall-through behavior should be considered

  Scenario: Handle ternary operator coverage
    Given source code with ternary operators
    When I analyze branch coverage
    Then both true and false paths should be tracked
    And nested ternary operators should be handled
    And coverage should be accurate for complex expressions

  Scenario: Analyze try-catch block coverage
    Given source code with exception handling
    When I analyze branch coverage
    Then try blocks should be tracked
    And catch blocks should be tracked separately
    And finally blocks should be included
    And exception paths should be considered

  Scenario: Handle loop condition coverage
    Given source code with various loop types
    When I analyze branch coverage
    Then loop entry conditions should be tracked
    And loop continuation conditions should be tracked
    And break and continue statements should be considered

  Scenario: Comprehensive branch coverage reporting
    Given complex source code with multiple branch types
    When I generate a branch coverage report
    Then the report should include overall branch percentage
    And it should list uncovered branches with line numbers
    And it should provide recommendations for improvement
    And it should highlight critical uncovered paths

  Scenario: Enhanced branch coverage with path analysis
    Given source code with interconnected conditionals
    When I perform enhanced branch coverage analysis
    Then execution paths should be traced
    And path coverage should be calculated
    And critical path combinations should be identified
    And missing path coverage should be reported

  Scenario: Branch coverage threshold validation
    Given branch coverage requirements
    And minimum coverage thresholds
    When I validate branch coverage against thresholds
    Then coverage should meet or exceed minimum requirements
    And violations should be clearly reported
    And improvement suggestions should be provided

  Scenario: Historical branch coverage tracking
    Given branch coverage data over time
    When I analyze coverage trends
    Then coverage improvements should be tracked
    And coverage regressions should be identified
    And trends should be visualized appropriately
    And alerts should be generated for significant changes
