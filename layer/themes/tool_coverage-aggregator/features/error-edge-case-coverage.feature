Feature: Error and Edge Case Coverage Analysis
  As a quality assurance engineer
  I want to analyze coverage of error handling and edge cases
  So that I can ensure robust and reliable software

  Background:
    Given an error and edge case analysis environment
    And source code with error handling mechanisms

  Scenario: Analyze exception handling coverage
    Given source code with try-catch blocks
    And various exception types
    When I analyze exception handling coverage
    Then catch blocks should be tracked for coverage
    And different exception types should be identified
    And uncaught exception paths should be reported
    And exception handling completeness should be assessed

  Scenario: Detect edge case scenario coverage
    Given source code with boundary conditions
    And input validation logic
    When I analyze edge case coverage
    Then boundary value tests should be identified
    And edge case scenarios should be tracked
    And missing edge case coverage should be reported
    And critical edge cases should be prioritized

  Scenario: Analyze error propagation patterns
    Given source code with error propagation chains
    When I analyze error propagation coverage
    Then error flow paths should be tracked
    And propagation completeness should be assessed
    And error handling gaps should be identified
    And error recovery mechanisms should be evaluated

  Scenario: Validate input validation coverage
    Given source code with input validation
    And various input scenarios
    When I analyze input validation coverage
    Then valid input paths should be covered
    And invalid input handling should be tested
    And malformed input scenarios should be included
    And security-related validations should be prioritized

  Scenario: Assess null and undefined handling coverage
    Given source code with null/undefined checks
    When I analyze null handling coverage
    Then null check coverage should be measured
    And undefined handling should be tracked
    And defensive programming patterns should be identified
    And potential null pointer issues should be flagged

  Scenario: Analyze timeout and resource limit handling
    Given source code with timeout mechanisms
    And resource limit handling
    When I analyze timeout coverage
    Then timeout scenarios should be tested
    And resource exhaustion handling should be covered
    And graceful degradation should be verified
    And recovery mechanisms should be validated

  Scenario: Evaluate concurrent access error handling
    Given source code with concurrent operations
    When I analyze concurrency error coverage
    Then race condition handling should be tested
    And deadlock prevention should be verified
    And thread safety mechanisms should be covered
    And synchronization error handling should be assessed

  Scenario: Analyze network and I/O error coverage
    Given source code with network operations
    And file I/O operations
    When I analyze I/O error coverage
    Then network failure scenarios should be tested
    And file operation errors should be handled
    And retry mechanisms should be verified
    And fallback strategies should be validated

  Scenario: Assess memory and performance edge cases
    Given source code with memory management
    And performance-critical sections
    When I analyze performance edge case coverage
    Then memory limit scenarios should be tested
    And performance degradation should be handled
    And resource cleanup should be verified
    And optimization edge cases should be covered

  Scenario: Generate comprehensive error coverage reports
    Given error and edge case analysis results
    When I generate error coverage reports
    Then error handling completeness should be summarized
    And critical gaps should be highlighted
    And risk assessment should be provided
    And remediation priorities should be suggested

  Scenario: Integrate error coverage with quality gates
    Given error coverage requirements
    And quality gate thresholds
    When I validate error coverage against gates
    Then error handling coverage should meet thresholds
    And edge case coverage should be sufficient
    And quality gates should pass or fail accordingly
    And improvement recommendations should be provided

  Scenario: Track error coverage trends and improvements
    Given historical error coverage data
    When I analyze error coverage trends
    Then improvements in error handling should be tracked
    And regressions should be identified
    And trend analysis should guide future testing
    And proactive error prevention should be supported
