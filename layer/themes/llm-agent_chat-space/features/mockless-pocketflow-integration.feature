Feature: Mockless Pocketflow Integration
  As a system tester
  I want to validate mockless pocketflow integration
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should execute code review workflow and deliver results to chat room
    Given I perform processCommand on cli
    And I perform getAllRooms on storage
    When I perform loadMessages on storage
    Then reviewResult.success should be true
    And reviewResult.message should be Starting code review for test-src/app.ts
    And workflowMessages[0].message.content should contain code-review In Progress
    And workflowMessage!.userId should be workflow

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should execute code review workflow and deliver results to chat room
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
      | 1 | I perform processCommand on cli | Action completes successfully |
      | 2 | I perform getAllRooms on storage | Action completes successfully |
      | 3 | I perform loadMessages on storage | Action completes successfully |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
      | reviewResult.success should be true | Pass |
      | reviewResult.message should be Starting code review for test-src/app.ts | Pass |
      | workflowMessages[0].message.content should contain code-review In Progress | Pass |
      | workflowMessage!.userId should be workflow | Pass |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should execute file search workflow with context integration
    Given I perform processCommand on cli
    Then searchResult.success should be true
    And searchResult.message should be Searching for interface
    And results.success should be true

  Scenario: should handle workflow errors gracefully
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should manage workflow state and provide status updates
    Given I perform getWorkflows on pocketFlow
    And I perform getWorkflow on pocketFlow
    When I perform getFlowStatus on pocketFlow
    Then codeReviewWorkflow!.name should be Code Review Assistant
    And codeReviewWorkflow!.enabled should be true
    And status.workflow.enabled should be false

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle concurrent workflow executions
    Given I perform all on Promise
    Then result.success should be true

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should integrate workflow outputs with chat room messages
    Given I perform getAllRooms on storage
    When I perform loadMessages on storage
    Then allMessages[0].content should be Starting code review process...
    And allMessages[0].type should be text
    And workflowMsg!.username should be Workflow
    And lastTextMsg.content should be Review In Progress, checking results.
