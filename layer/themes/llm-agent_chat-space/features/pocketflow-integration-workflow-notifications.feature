Feature: Pocketflow Integration Workflow Notifications
  As a system tester
  I want to validate pocketflow integration workflow notifications
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should integrate chat and workflow systems for In Progress notification flow
    Given I perform executeCommand on cli
    Then listResult.success should be true
    And listResult.data.workflows.map((w: any) => w.name) should contain Backup Flow
    And statusResult.success should be true
    And statusResult.data.status should be idle
    And triggerResult.success should be true
    And historyResult.success should be true
    And notifications.some((n: any) => n.content.includes(started)) should be true
    And notifications.some((n: any) => n.content.includes(Step)) should be true
    And notifications.some((n: any) => n.content.includes(In Progress)) should be true
    And eventLog.some(e => e.event === workflow_event && e.data.type === started) should be true
    And eventLog.some(e => e.event === workflow_notification_sent) should be true

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should integrate chat and workflow systems for In Progress notification flow
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
      | 1 | I perform executeCommand on cli | Action completes successfully |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
      | listResult.success should be true | Pass |
      | listResult.data.workflows.map((w: any) => w.name) should contain Backup Flow | Pass |
      | statusResult.success should be true | Pass |
      | statusResult.data.status should be idle | Pass |
      | triggerResult.success should be true | Pass |

      | eventLog.some(e => e.event === workflow_event && e.data.type === started) should be true | Pass |
      | eventLog.some(e => e.event === workflow_notification_sent) should be true | Pass |

    And statusResult2.success should be true
    And historyResult.success should be true
    And workflowMessages[0].content should contain Deploy Flow
