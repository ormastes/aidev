Feature: Flow Validation System
  As a user of the system
  I want to ensure flow validation system works correctly
  So that I can rely on the system's functionality

  Scenario: validate and execute a complete flow
    Given the system is initialized
    When I validation response
    And I validation result
    And I execution response
    And I execution result
    And I save flow
    And I json
    And I to be
    And I to have length
    And I stringify
    And I json
    And I to be
    And I to contain
    And I to be
    Then the validate and execute a complete flow should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle validation errors properly
    Given the system is initialized
    When I response
    And I result
    And I save flow
    And I stringify
    And I json
    And I to be
    And I to be
    And I to contain equal
    And I object containing
    And I string containing
    Then the handle validation errors properly should complete successfully

  Scenario: stream flow execution events via WebSocket
    Given the system is initialized
    When I save flow
    And I on
    And I on
    And I push
    And I parse
    And I to string
    And I send
    And I stringify
    And I stringify
    And I to be greater than
    And I to contain equal
    And I object containing
    And I to contain equal
    And I object containing
    And I to contain equal
    And I object containing
    And I close
    Then the stream flow execution events via WebSocket should complete successfully

  Scenario: import flows from various formats
    Given the system is initialized
    When I json response
    And I json result
    And I yaml response
    And I stringify
    And I stringify
    And I to be
    And I json
    And I to be
    And I stringify
    And I to be
    Then the import flows from various formats should complete successfully

  Scenario: export flows in different formats
    Given the system is initialized
    When I fetch
    And I fetch
    And I json export
    And I json content
    And I yaml export
    And I yaml content
    And I save flow
    And I to be
    And I json
    And I to be
    And I to have length
    And I to be
    And I text
    And I to contain
    And I to contain
    Then the export flows in different formats should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle concurrent flow executions
    Given the system is initialized
    When I fetch
    And I responses
    And I metrics response
    And I metrics
    And I random
    And I save flow
    And I now
    And I fill
    And I map
    And I stringify
    And I all
    And I now
    And I for each
    And I to be
    And I to be less than
    And I json
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I to be less than or equal
    Then the handle concurrent flow executions should complete successfully

  Scenario: enforce rate limiting
    Given the system is initialized
    When I responses
    And I rate limited response
    And I save flow
    And I fill
    And I map
    And I stringify
    And I all
    And I filter
    And I to be greater than
    And I json
    And I to contain
    Then the enforce rate limiting should complete successfully

  Scenario: maintain flow version history
    Given the system is initialized
    When I fetch
    And I history response
    And I history
    And I v1 response
    And I v1 result
    And I save flow
    And I save flow
    And I json
    And I to have length
    And I to be
    And I to be
    And I stringify
    And I json
    And I to be
    And I to equal
    Then the maintain flow version history should complete successfully

  Scenario: recover from node failures
    Given the system is initialized
    When I results
    And I save flow
    And I all
    And I fill
    And I map
    And I stringify
    And I then
    And I json
    And I filter
    And I to be greater than
    And I for each
    And I to be defined
    Then the recover from node failures should complete successfully
