Feature: End To End Filtering
  As a user of the system
  I want to ensure end to end filtering works correctly
  So that I can rely on the system's functionality

  Scenario: filter logs by level in real-time during actual process execution
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I on
    And I push
    And I push
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I log
    And I log
    And I error
    And I log
    And I log
    And I error
    And I log
    And I log
    And I on
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I to be less than
    And I map
    And I for each
    And I to contain
    And I map
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I log
    And I log
    And I from
    And I join
    Then the filter logs by level in real-time during actual process execution should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle dynamic filter updates during long-running process
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I on
    And I push
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I log
    And I error
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I error
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I push
    And I set log level filter
    And I push
    And I set log level filter
    And I push
    And I on
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I map
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I filter
    And I map
    And I every
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I filter
    And I map
    And I every
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I log
    And I log
    Then the handle dynamic filter updates during long-running process should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle complex log patterns with mixed formats
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I on
    And I push
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I log
    And I error
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I error
    And I log
    And I log
    And I error
    And I on
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I map
    And I map
    And I filter
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I filter
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I log
    And I log
    And I filter
    And I filter
    Then the handle complex log patterns with mixed formats should complete successfully

  Scenario: maintain performance under high-volume log generation
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I now
    And I on
    And I push
    And I now
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I error
    And I log
    And I log
    And I on
    And I now
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I to be less than
    And I to be less than
    And I map
    And I every
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I to fixed
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I to fixed
    Then the maintain performance under high-volume log generation should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle filter configuration edge cases gracefully
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I log
    And I error
    And I on
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I to be
    And I log
    And I log
    Then the handle filter configuration edge cases gracefully should complete successfully

  Scenario: work with typical application log patterns
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I on
    And I push
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I error
    And I log
    And I error
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I on
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I filter
    And I filter
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I map
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I log
    And I log
    Then the work with typical application log patterns should complete successfully
