Feature: End To End Monitoring
  As a user of the system
  I want to ensure end to end monitoring works correctly
  So that I can rely on the system's functionality

  Scenario: monitor multi-format logs with level filtering in real-time
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I to be defined
    And I on
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I some
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I to be
    And I to be greater than
    And I for each
    And I to contain
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I includes
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I every
    And I to be
    And I every
    And I to be
    Then the monitor multi-format logs with level filtering in real-time should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle high-volume real-time streaming with backpressure
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I now
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I to be defined
    And I on
    And I now
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be less than
    And I map
    And I get time
    And I max
    And I min
    And I to be greater than
    And I map
    And I to be greater than
    And I has
    And I to be
    And I to be greater than
    And I log
    And I to fixed
    Then the handle high-volume real-time streaming with backpressure should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle process crashes and maintain monitoring integrity
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I on
    And I some
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I to be
    And I find
    And I to be
    And I to be
    And I to be defined
    And I to be greater than
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I get monitoring status
    And I to be
    Then the handle process crashes and maintain monitoring integrity should complete successfully

  Scenario: support multiple concurrent monitoring sessions with different filters
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id1
    And I process id2
    And I process id3
    And I on
    And I includes
    And I push
    And I includes
    And I push
    And I includes
    And I push
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I bind
    And I on
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be greater than
    And I for each
    And I to be
    And I for each
    And I to contain
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I get monitoring status
    And I to be
    Then the support multiple concurrent monitoring sessions with different filters should complete successfully

  Scenario: maintain performance under stress with monitoring status tracking
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process ids
    And I on
    And I now
    And I push
    And I push
    And I now
    And I get monitoring status
    And I push
    And I now
    And I memory usage
    And I push
    And I memory usage
    And I all
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I to have length
    And I every
    And I to be
    And I on
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I max
    And I map
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I reduce
    And I to be less than
    And I max
    And I min
    And I to be less than
    And I log
    And I to fixed
    And I to fixed
    Then the maintain performance under stress with monitoring status tracking should complete successfully
