Feature: Backpressure Management
  As a user of the system
  I want to ensure backpressure management works correctly
  So that I can rely on the system's functionality

  Scenario: handle high-burst logging without data loss
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I now
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I push
    And I memory usage
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I to be defined
    And I on
    And I now
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be less than
    And I filter
    And I includes
    And I includes
    And I to be greater than
    And I map
    And I to be greater than
    And I filter
    And I includes
    And I to be greater than
    And I max
    And I min
    And I to be less than
    And I log
    Then the handle high-burst logging without data loss should complete successfully

  Scenario: maintain throughput under continuous flood conditions
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I now
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I now
    And I push
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I to be defined
    And I on
    And I now
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be greater than
    And I slice
    And I floor
    And I slice
    And I floor
    And I reduce
    And I reduce
    And I to be greater than
    And I filter
    And I includes
    And I includes
    And I filter
    And I includes
    And I includes
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be greater than
    And I log
    And I to fixed
    Then the maintain throughput under continuous flood conditions should complete successfully

  Scenario: adapt to variable rate logging patterns
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I now
    And I on
    And I push
    And I push
    And I now
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I to be defined
    And I on
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be greater than
    And I push
    And I min
    And I max
    And I to be greater than
    And I filter
    And I includes
    And I includes
    And I includes
    And I to be greater than
    And I log
    And I to fixed
    And I to fixed
    Then the adapt to variable rate logging patterns should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle memory-stressed processes without degradation
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I now
    And I on
    And I push
    And I includes
    And I includes
    And I match
    And I push
    And I now
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I to be defined
    And I on
    And I now
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be less than
    And I to be greater than
    And I filter
    And I to be greater than
    And I filter
    And I filter
    And I filter
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I to be greater than
    And I log
    Then the handle memory-stressed processes without degradation should complete successfully

  Scenario: manage concurrent overload from multiple processes
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process ids
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I get monitoring status
    And I max
    And I all
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I to have length
    And I every
    And I to be
    And I on
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I to be
    And I for each
    And I match
    And I add
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I slice
    And I floor
    And I slice
    And I floor
    And I for each
    And I match
    And I add
    And I for each
    And I match
    And I add
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be greater than
    And I get monitoring status
    And I to be
    And I log
    Then the manage concurrent overload from multiple processes should complete successfully
