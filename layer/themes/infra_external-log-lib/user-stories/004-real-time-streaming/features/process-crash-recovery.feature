Feature: Process Crash Recovery
  As a user of the system
  I want to ensure process crash recovery works correctly
  So that I can rely on the system's functionality

  Scenario: handle immediate process exits with different exit codes
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I on
    And I on
    And I to have length
    And I some
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I to be
    And I every
    And I to be
    And I every
    And I to be
    And I for each
    And I to be defined
    And I to be instance of
    And I to be
    Then the handle immediate process exits with different exit codes should complete successfully

  Scenario: capture logs before delayed crashes and provide crash context
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I on
    And I to be greater than
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I for each
    And I to be defined
    And I to be
    And I to be defined
    And I is array
    And I to be
    And I to be greater than
    And I flat map
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    Then the capture logs before delayed crashes and provide crash context should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle memory exhaustion and resource limit crashes
    Given the system is initialized
    When I memory process id
    And I resource process id
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I on
    And I on
    And I filter
    And I includes
    And I to be greater than
    And I filter
    And I includes
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I map
    And I match
    And I filter
    And I max
    And I min
    And I to be greater than
    Then the handle memory exhaustion and resource limit crashes should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle abrupt process termination and cleanup properly
    Given the system is initialized
    When I segfault process id
    And I abort process id
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I push
    And I now
    And I get monitoring status
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I on
    And I some
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I to be
    And I get monitoring status
    And I to be
    And I to have length
    And I max
    And I map
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I to be greater than
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    Then the handle abrupt process termination and cleanup properly should complete successfully

  Scenario: support crash recovery and restart monitoring after failures
    Given the system is initialized
    When I restart process
    And I process id
    And I final process id
    And I on
    And I push
    And I now
    And I on
    And I push
    And I now
    And I on
    And I push
    And I now
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I on
    And I on
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I some
    And I to be
    And I get monitoring status
    And I to be
    And I map
    And I sort
    And I to equal
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I to be defined
    And I on
    And I get monitoring status
    And I to be
    Then the support crash recovery and restart monitoring after failures should complete successfully
