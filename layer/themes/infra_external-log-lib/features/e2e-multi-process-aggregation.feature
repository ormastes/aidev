Feature: E2e Multi Process Aggregation
  As a system tester
  I want to validate e2e multi process aggregation
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should capture, aggregate, and query logs from a In Progress multi-process application
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should capture, aggregate, and query logs from a In Progress multi-process application
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle high-throughput multi-process log aggregation under load
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual

    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should maintain data consistency during concurrent process lifecycle events
    Then the operation should complete successfully
