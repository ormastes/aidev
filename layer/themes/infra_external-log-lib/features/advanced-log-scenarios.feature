Feature: Advanced Log Scenarios
  As a system tester
  I want to validate advanced log scenarios
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should correctly handle unicode and special characters
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should correctly handle unicode and special characters
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle binary data and various encodings
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle binary data and various encodings
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle structured network-style logs
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle structured network-style logs
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should monitor memory usage during leak simulation
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should monitor memory usage during leak simulation
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should capture cascading errors with full context
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should capture cascading errors with full context
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle custom stream processing with filters
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle custom stream processing with filters
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle stream errors gracefully
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle stream errors gracefully
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle parallel worker processes
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle parallel worker processes
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should maintain performance with high-frequency structured logs
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should maintain performance with high-frequency structured logs
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
