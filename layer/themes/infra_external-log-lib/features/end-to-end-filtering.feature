Feature: End To End Filtering
  As a system tester
  I want to validate end to end filtering
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should filter logs by level in real-time during actual process execution
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should filter logs by level in real-time during actual process execution
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle dynamic filter updates during long-running process
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle dynamic filter updates during long-running process
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle complex log patterns with mixed formats
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle complex log patterns with mixed formats
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should maintain performance under high-volume log generation
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should maintain performance under high-volume log generation
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle filter configuration edge cases gracefully
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle filter configuration edge cases gracefully
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should work with typical application log patterns
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should work with typical application log patterns
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
