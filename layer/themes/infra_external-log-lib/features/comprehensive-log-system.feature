Feature: Comprehensive Log System
  As a system tester
  I want to validate comprehensive log system
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should capture logs from real processes in real-time
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should capture logs from real processes in real-time
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle multiple concurrent real processes
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle multiple concurrent real processes
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should filter logs by level in real-time
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should filter logs by level in real-time
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should support dynamic filter updates during monitoring
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should support dynamic filter updates during monitoring
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle partial line buffering correctly
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle partial line buffering correctly
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle high-frequency burst logging without data loss
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle high-frequency burst logging without data loss
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |

      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should save logs in multiple formats with real data
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual

      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle append mode correctly
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle append mode correctly
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle process crashes gracefully
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle process crashes gracefully
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should terminate long-running processes gracefully
    Then the operation should complete successfully

      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should prepare logs for transport to external systems
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
