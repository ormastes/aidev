Feature: Comprehensive Log System
  As a user of the system
  I want to ensure comprehensive log system works correctly
  So that I can rely on the system's functionality

  Scenario: capture logs from real processes in real-time
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process id
    And I on
    And I push
    And I push
    And I now
    And I start real time monitoring
    And I join
    And I to be defined
    And I on
    And I to be greater than
    And I push
    And I reduce
    And I to be greater than
    And I max
    And I to be greater than
    Then the capture logs from real processes in real-time should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle multiple concurrent real processes
    Given the system is initialized
    When I process ids
    And I on
    And I has
    And I set
