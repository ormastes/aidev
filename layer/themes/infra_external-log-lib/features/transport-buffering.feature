Feature: Transport Buffering
  As a user of the system
  I want to ensure transport buffering works correctly
  So that I can rely on the system's functionality

  Scenario: \\n
    Given the system is initialized
    When I trim
    And I parse
    And I push
    And I write
    And I stringify
    And I to i s o string
    And I log
    And I error
    Then the \\n should complete successfully
