Feature: Transport Buffering
  As a system tester
  I want to validate transport buffering
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle high-rate log production with buffering
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle high-rate log production with buffering
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle buffer overflow scenarios gracefully
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle buffer overflow scenarios gracefully
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should simulate TCP transport with acknowledgments
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should simulate TCP transport with acknowledgments
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should simulate HTTP batch transport with retry logic
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should simulate HTTP batch transport with retry logic
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should implement file-based buffering with rotation
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should implement file-based buffering with rotation
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should prepare logs for various transport formats
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should prepare logs for various transport formats
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle backpressure without memory leaks
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle backpressure without memory leaks
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
