Feature: Error Log Filtering E2e
  As a system tester
  I want to validate error log filtering e2e
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should filter error logs from a real application
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should filter error logs from a real application
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should support dynamic filter updates in production-like scenario
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should support dynamic filter updates in production-like scenario
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle multiple concurrent filtered processes
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle multiple concurrent filtered processes
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle high-volume filtered logging in production scenario
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle high-volume filtered logging in production scenario
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
