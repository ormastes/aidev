Feature: Structured Log Parsing
  As a system tester
  I want to validate structured log parsing
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should capture and parse JSON logs from Node.js application
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should capture and parse JSON logs from Node.js application
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should validate logs against JSON schema
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should validate logs against JSON schema
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should provide metadata querying capabilities
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should provide metadata querying capabilities
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle format auto-detection correctly
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle format auto-detection correctly
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle concurrent log streams correctly
    Then the operation should complete successfully
