Feature: Test Environment System Management
  As a test engineer
  I want to manage test environments consistently
  So that I can ensure reliable and repeatable testing

  Background:
    Given a test environment system
    And environment configuration is available

  Scenario: Initialize test environment with default settings
    Given default environment configuration
    When I initialize the test environment
    Then the environment should be set up with default values
    And all required services should be available
    And the environment should be ready for testing

  Scenario: Configure test environment with custom settings
    Given custom environment configuration
    And specific service requirements
    When I configure the test environment
    Then the environment should use custom settings
    And services should be configured according to requirements
    And custom validation rules should be applied

  Scenario: Set up isolated test environments
    Given multiple test scenarios
    And isolation requirements
    When I create isolated test environments
    Then each environment should be completely isolated
    And there should be no cross-contamination
    And resources should be properly allocated

  Scenario: Manage environment lifecycle
    Given a test environment
    When I manage its complete lifecycle
    Then the environment should start up correctly
    And it should be configurable during runtime
    And it should shut down cleanly
    And resources should be properly released

  Scenario: Handle environment failures gracefully
    Given a test environment setup
    And potential failure conditions
    When failures occur during environment setup
    Then errors should be handled gracefully
    And meaningful error messages should be provided
    And partial setups should be cleaned up

  Scenario: Support multiple environment types
    Given different environment type requirements
    When I set up environments for different testing phases
    Then unit test environments should be lightweight
    And integration test environments should include dependencies
    And system test environments should be complete
    And each should be optimized for its purpose

  Scenario: Configure environment with external dependencies
    Given test requirements with external dependencies
    When I set up the environment
    Then external services should be available or mocked
    And dependency health should be verified
    And fallback mechanisms should be in place

  Scenario: Support environment state management
    Given test scenarios requiring state persistence
    When I manage environment state
    Then state should be preserved between test runs
    And state should be resettable when needed
    And state transitions should be tracked

  Scenario: Enable environment monitoring
    Given a running test environment
    When monitoring is enabled
    Then environment health should be tracked
    And resource usage should be monitored
    And alerts should be generated for anomalies
    And performance metrics should be collected

  Scenario: Support environment scaling
    Given varying test load requirements
    When environment scaling is needed
    Then resources should scale up and down automatically
    And scaling should be transparent to tests
    And performance should be maintained during scaling

  Scenario: Handle environment configuration drift
    Given an established test environment
    And configuration changes over time
    When configuration drift is detected
    Then drift should be identified and reported
    And automatic correction should be available
    And configuration history should be maintained

  Scenario: Support environment replication
    Given a proven test environment configuration
    When replication is needed for different contexts
    Then environments should be replicatable consistently
    And replication should preserve all important characteristics
    And differences should be configurable and documented

  Scenario: Enable environment debugging
    Given test failures in the environment
    When debugging is needed
    Then environment state should be inspectable
    And logs should be accessible and searchable
    And debugging tools should be available
    And troubleshooting guides should be provided

  Scenario: Support environment versioning
    Given evolving test requirements
    When environment changes are needed
    Then environment configurations should be versioned
    And rollback capabilities should be available
    And version compatibility should be maintained

  Scenario: Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
    Given CI/CD pipeline requirements
    When integrating test environments
    Then environments should integrate seamlessly
    And setup time should be minimized
    And cleanup should be automatic
    And parallel execution should be supported
