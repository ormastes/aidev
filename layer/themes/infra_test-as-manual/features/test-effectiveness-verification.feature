Feature: Test Effectiveness Verification
  As a test architect
  I want to verify the effectiveness of our test suite
  So that I can ensure comprehensive coverage and quality

  Background:
    Given the test effectiveness analyzer is configured
    And coverage metrics are being collected

  @automated @metrics
  Scenario: Measure code coverage metrics
    When I run the test suite with coverage enabled
    Then I should receive coverage metrics for:
      | Metric Type    | Minimum Threshold |
      | Line coverage  | 90%               |
      | Branch coverage| 85%               |
      | Function coverage | 90%            |
      | Statement coverage | 90%           |

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of coverage metrics
    Given the tester has access to coverage reports
    When the tester reviews coverage data:
      | Review Area          | Verification Points                |
      | Uncovered lines      | Identify critical missing tests    |
      | Branch coverage gaps | Check all decision paths          |
      | Dead code            | Find unreachable code sections    |
      | Edge cases           | Verify boundary conditions tested |
    Then verify coverage meets quality standards
    And identify areas needing additional tests

  @automated @effectiveness
  Scenario: Evaluate test quality scores
    Given I have test execution history
    When I calculate test effectiveness scores
    Then the scores should include:
      | Quality Metric        | Description                      |
      | Defect detection rate | Bugs found by tests vs production |
      | False positive ratio  | Invalid failures vs total failures |
      | Test stability        | Consistent pass/fail patterns     |
      | Execution time        | Performance benchmarks            |

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual assessment of test quality
    Given the tester has test quality metrics
    When the tester evaluates test effectiveness:
      | Assessment Area      | Criteria                        | Target          |
      | Bug detection        | Pre-production catch rate       | > 95%           |
      | False positives      | Flaky test percentage           | < 5%            |
      | Test maintenance     | Update frequency                | Monthly review  |
      | Risk coverage        | Critical path testing           | 100% coverage   |
    Then verify tests are effective at finding bugs
    And verify test suite is maintainable

  @automated @mutation
  Scenario: Run mutation testing analysis
    Given I have a codebase with tests
    When I introduce code mutations
    Then the test suite should detect:
      | Mutation Type         | Detection Rate |
      | Conditional changes   | > 90%          |
      | Arithmetic changes    | > 85%          |
      | Return value changes  | > 95%          |
      | Method call removal   | > 90%          |

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual mutation testing validation
    Given the tester can modify code temporarily
    When the tester introduces controlled mutations:
      | Code Change          | Test Expectation              |
      | Flip boolean         | Test should fail              |
      | Change operator      | Calculation tests fail        |
      | Remove validation    | Security tests detect issue   |
      | Alter boundaries     | Edge case tests catch change  |
    Then verify tests catch intentional bugs
    And identify tests that miss mutations

  @automated @performance
  Scenario: Analyze test execution performance
    When I profile test execution
    Then I should identify:
      | Performance Issue     | Threshold      |
      | Slow tests           | > 1 second     |
      | Resource intensive   | > 100MB memory |
      | Database heavy       | > 10 queries   |
      | Network dependent    | > 5 API calls  |

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual performance optimization review
    Given the tester has performance profiling data
    When the tester analyzes test performance:
      | Analysis Focus       | Action                          |
      | Bottlenecks          | Identify slowest tests          |
      | Parallelization      | Find tests that can run parallel|
      | Resource usage       | Monitor memory and CPU          |
      | Test isolation       | Verify independent execution    |
    Then verify performance meets requirements
    And identify optimization opportunities

  @automated @regression
  Scenario: Detect regression test gaps
    Given I have code change history
    When I analyze test coverage for changes
    Then I should identify:
      | Gap Type             | Required Action              |
      | Untested changes     | Add regression tests         |
      | Modified interfaces  | Update integration tests     |
      | New features         | Create feature tests         |
      | Bug fixes            | Add reproduction tests       |

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual regression test planning
    Given the tester has access to change logs
    When the tester reviews regression coverage:
      | Change Type          | Test Verification              |
      | Feature additions    | New feature fully tested       |
      | Bug fixes            | Regression test added          |
      | Refactoring          | Existing tests still pass      |
      | Performance updates  | Benchmark tests updated        |
    Then verify all changes have appropriate tests
    And ensure no regression gaps exist
