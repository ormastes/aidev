Feature: Test Failure Detection and Reporting
  As a QA engineer
  I want to detect and analyze test failures
  So that I can maintain test suite quality

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And test failure detection is enabled

  @automated @validation
  Scenario: Detect test execution failures
    Given I have a test suite with failing tests
    When I run the test suite
    Then failures should be detected and logged
    And a failure report should be generated

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of test failure detection
    Given the tester has access to the test execution dashboard
    When the tester runs tests with known failures:
      | Test Type      | Failure Type         | Expected Detection      |
      | Unit test      | Assertion failure    | Logged with stack trace |
      | Integration    | Timeout              | Marked as timeout       |
      | System test    | Connection error     | Network issue flagged   |
      | E2E test       | Element not found    | UI error reported       |
    Then verify all failures are properly detected
    And verify detailed error information is captured

  @automated @validation
  Scenario: Analyze test failure patterns
    Given I have historical test execution data
    When I analyze failure patterns over time
    Then common failure causes should be identified
    And failure trends should be visualized

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual analysis of failure patterns
    Given the tester has access to test history
    When the tester reviews failure patterns:
      | Analysis Type        | Focus Area              | Expected Insight           |
      | Frequency analysis   | Most failing tests      | Top 10 problematic tests   |
      | Root cause analysis  | Common error types      | Primary failure reasons    |
      | Trend analysis       | Failure rate over time  | Increasing/decreasing trend|
      | Impact assessment    | Critical path tests     | Business impact score      |
    Then verify patterns are correctly identified
    And verify actionable insights are provided

  @automated @reporting
  Scenario: Generate comprehensive failure reports
    Given test failures have been detected
    When I request a failure report
    Then the report should include:
      | Section              | Content                    |
      | Summary              | Total pass/fail count      |
      | Failed Tests         | List with error details    |
      | Stack Traces         | Full error traces          |
      | Environment Info     | System configuration       |
      | Recommendations      | Suggested fixes            |

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of failure reports
    Given the tester has generated failure reports
    When the tester reviews report quality:
      | Report Element       | Verification                   |
      | Completeness         | All failures included          |
      | Accuracy             | Error details are correct      |
      | Readability          | Clear and well-formatted       |
      | Actionability        | Contains useful suggestions    |
      | Distribution         | Sent to correct stakeholders   |
    Then verify reports meet quality standards
    And verify reports aid in troubleshooting

  @automated @recovery
  Scenario: Automatic test retry on transient failures
    Given a test fails with a transient error
    When the retry mechanism is triggered
    Then the test should be retried up to 3 times
    And success on retry should be logged

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of retry mechanism
    Given the tester can simulate transient failures
    When the tester tests retry scenarios:
      | Failure Type         | Retry Count | Expected Behavior         |
      | Network timeout      | 3           | Retry with backoff        |
      | Resource busy        | 2           | Wait and retry            |
      | Intermittent error   | 3           | Succeed on retry          |
      | Permanent failure    | 3           | Fail after all retries    |
    Then verify retry logic works correctly
    And verify appropriate delays between retries
