Feature: Pocketflow Complete
  As a system tester
  I want to validate pocketflow complete
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should execute a complete workflow simulation
    Given I perform execute on node
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should execute a complete workflow simulation
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
      | 1 | I perform execute on node | Action completes successfully |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle agent-based workflows
    Given I perform process on agent
    When I perform execute on workflow
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle agent-based workflows
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
      | 1 | I perform process on agent | Action completes successfully |
      | 2 | I perform execute on workflow | Action completes successfully |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should execute workflow patterns
    Given I perform process on worker
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should execute workflow patterns
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
      | 1 | I perform process on worker | Action completes successfully |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle file-based state management
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle file-based state management
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle concurrent workflow execution
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle concurrent workflow execution
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
