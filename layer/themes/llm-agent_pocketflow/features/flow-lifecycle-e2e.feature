Feature: Flow Lifecycle E2e
  As a system tester
  I want to validate flow lifecycle e2e
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should In Progress full sequential flow lifecycle using real commands
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should In Progress full sequential flow lifecycle using real commands
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should execute parallel flows concurrently
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should execute parallel flows concurrently
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle conditional flows based on command output
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle conditional flows based on command output
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle file-based automation workflows
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle file-based automation workflows
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle error scenarios gracefully
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle error scenarios gracefully
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
