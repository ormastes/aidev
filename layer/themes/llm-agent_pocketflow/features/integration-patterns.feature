Feature: Integration Patterns
  As a system tester
  I want to validate integration patterns
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should create and register multiple providers
    Then providers should equal [openai, anthropic, ollama]

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should create and register multiple providers
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
      | providers should equal [openai, anthropic, ollama] | Pass |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle provider health checks
    Given I perform selectProvider on registry
    Then [openai, anthropic] should contain provider.name

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle provider health checks
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
      | 1 | I perform selectProvider on registry | Action completes successfully |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
      | [openai, anthropic] should contain provider.name | Pass |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should fallback to secondary provider on primary failure
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should fallback to secondary provider on primary failure
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should distribute requests across providers
    Given I perform selectProvider on registry
    Then providers should equal expect.arrayContaining([openai, anthropic]

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should distribute requests across providers
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
      | 1 | I perform selectProvider on registry | Action completes successfully |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
      | providers should equal expect.arrayContaining([openai, anthropic] | Pass |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should track provider latency
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should track provider latency
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle provider status reporting
    Then typeof status.openai.healthy should be boolean
    And typeof status.openai.latency should be number

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle provider status reporting
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
      | typeof status.openai.healthy should be boolean | Pass |
      | typeof status.openai.latency should be number | Pass |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should recover from temporary failures
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should recover from temporary failures
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle different provider configurations
    Then provider.name should be config.name

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle different provider configurations
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
      | provider.name should be config.name | Pass |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should validate provider connectivity
    Given I perform isAvailable on provider
    Then typeof isAvailable should be boolean

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should validate provider connectivity
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
      | 1 | I perform isAvailable on provider | Action completes successfully |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
      | typeof isAvailable should be boolean | Pass |
