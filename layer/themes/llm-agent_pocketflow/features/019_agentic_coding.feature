Feature: 019_agentic_coding
  As a system tester
  I want to validate 019_agentic_coding
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should generate code through UI workflow
    Given I click on the page
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should generate code through UI workflow
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
      | 1 | I click on the page | Action completes successfully |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should handle code generation errors gracefully
    Given I click on the page
    When I perform textContent on page
    Then error should contain Requirements are required

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should handle code generation errors gracefully
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
      | 1 | I click on the page | Action completes successfully |
      | 2 | I perform textContent on page | Action completes successfully |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
      | error should contain Requirements are required | Pass |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should save and load code generation sessions
    Given I click on the page
    When I perform inputValue on page
    Then requirements should be Sort an array
