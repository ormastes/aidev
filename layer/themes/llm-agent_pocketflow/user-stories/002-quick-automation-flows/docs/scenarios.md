# 002-quick-automation-flows Scenarios

## User Story
**As a developer**, I want to set up quick automation flows for repetitive tasks so that I can reduce manual work in my development process.

## Core Scenarios

### 1. Define Simple Automation Flow
- User defines a flow with a name and description
- User specifies a trigger (e.g., file change, time-based, manual)
- User adds one or more actions to execute
- System validates flow configuration
- System saves flow definition

### 2. Execute Flow Manually
- User selects a flow to execute
- System validates flow is enabled
- System executes actions in sequence
- System logs execution results
- User receives execution status

### 3. Trigger Flow Automatically
- File system event occurs (create/modify/delete)
- System detects event matches trigger pattern
- System loads associated flow
- System executes flow actions
- System logs automatic execution

### 4. Monitor Flow Execution
- User requests flow execution history
- System retrieves recent executions
- System displays status (IN PROGRESS/failure/running)
- System shows execution timestamps
- User can view detailed logs

### 5. Update Existing Flow
- User selects flow to modify
- User updates trigger conditions or actions
- System validates updated configuration
- System saves changes
- Previous executions remain in history

### 6. Disable/Enable Flow
- User toggles flow enabled status
- System updates flow state
- Disabled flows don't trigger automatically
- Manual execution still allowed when disabled

### 7. Delete Flow
- User requests flow deletion
- System checks for active executions
- System prevents deletion if running
- System removes flow and preserves history
- Associated logs remain accessible

### 8. Chain Multiple Actions
- User adds multiple actions to a flow
- Actions execute in defined order
- Each action receives previous output
- Failure in one action stops chain
- System logs each action result

### 9. Handle Flow Execution Errors
- Action fails during execution
- System captures error details
- System marks execution as failed
- System logs error information
- User can retry failed execution

### 10. List All Flows
- User requests flow list
- System retrieves all flows
- System shows flow status (enabled/disabled)
- System displays last execution time
- User can filter by status

## Edge Cases

### 11. Invalid Trigger Pattern
- User provides malformed trigger pattern
- System validates and rejects
- Clear error message provided
- Flow not saved

### 12. Circular Flow Dependencies
- Flow A triggers Flow B which triggers Flow A
- System detects circular reference
- System prevents infinite loop
- Execution stops with error

### 13. Concurrent Flow Executions
- Same flow triggered multiple times
- System handles concurrent runs
- Each execution tracked separately
- Resources managed properly

### 14. Large Action Output
- Action produces excessive output
- System truncates for storage
- Full output available temporarily
- Warning logged about truncation

### 15. Missing Action Resources
- Action references non-existent file/command
- System detects missing resource
- Execution fails gracefully
- Clear error in logs

## Technical Scenarios

### 16. Flow Definition Persistence
- Flows stored as JSON files
- Atomic write operations
- Backup before modifications
- Recovery from corruption

### 17. Execution Context Isolation
- Each execution has unique ID
- Variables scoped to execution
- No interference between runs
- Clean up after completion

### 18. Event Queue Management
- Multiple triggers fire simultaneously
- Events queued for processing
- FIFO execution order
- Queue persistence across restarts
