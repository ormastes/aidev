Feature: Integration Patterns
  As a user of the system
  I want to ensure integration patterns works correctly
  So that I can rely on the system's functionality

  Scenario: create and register multiple providers
    Given the system is initialized
    When I create provider
    And I create provider
    And I create provider
    And I to be instance of
    And I to be instance of
    And I to be instance of
    And I list providers
    And I to equal
    Then the create and register multiple providers should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle provider health checks
    Given the system is initialized
    When I create provider
    And I check health
    And I get provider status
    And I to have property
    And I to have property
    And I to have property
    Then the handle provider health checks should complete successfully

  Scenario: select healthy providers for load balancing
    Given the system is initialized
    When I provider
    And I create provider
    And I create provider
    And I select provider
    And I to be defined
    And I to contain
    Then the select healthy providers for load balancing should complete successfully

  Scenario: fallback to secondary provider on primary failure
    Given the system is initialized
    When I result
    And I create provider
    And I create provider
    And I create completion with fallback
    And I to be defined
    And I to be
    And I to contain
    Then the fallback to secondary provider on primary failure should complete successfully

  Scenario: distribute requests across providers
    Given the system is initialized
    When I provider
    And I create provider
    And I create provider
    And I select provider
    And I push
    And I to equal
    And I array containing
    Then the distribute requests across providers should complete successfully

  Scenario: track provider latency
    Given the system is initialized
    When I create provider
    And I create completion with fallback
    And I get provider status
    And I to be greater than
    And I log
    Then the track provider latency should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle provider status reporting
    Given the system is initialized
    When I create provider
    And I check health
    And I get provider status
    And I to have property
    And I to have property
    And I to be
    And I to be
    Then the handle provider status reporting should complete successfully

  Scenario: recover from temporary failures
    Given the system is initialized
    When I create provider
    And I create completion with fallback
    And I to throw
    Then the recover from temporary failures should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle network timeouts
    Given the system is initialized
    When I create provider
    And I create completion with fallback
    And I to throw
    Then the handle network timeouts should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle different provider configurations
    Given the system is initialized
    When I for each
    And I create provider
    And I to be
    And I list providers
    And I to equal
    Then the handle different provider configurations should complete successfully

  Scenario: validate provider connectivity
    Given the system is initialized
    When I is available
    And I create provider
    And I get provider
    And I is available
    And I to be
    And I log
    Then the validate provider connectivity should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle streaming responses
    Given the system is initialized
    When I create provider
    And I stream completion with fallback
    And I push
    And I to be greater than
    And I log
    Then the handle streaming responses should complete successfully
