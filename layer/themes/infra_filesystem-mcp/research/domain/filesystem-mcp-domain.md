# Domain Research: Filesystem MCP Implementation

## Domain Analysis

### Core Domain Concepts

#### 1. Entity Management
- **Entities**: Abstract data structures (task_queue, id_name, file_struct)
- **Entity Lifecycle**: Creation, initialization, read/write operations, persistence
- **Entity Relationships**: How entities interact and reference each other

#### 2. Queue Management
- **Priority Queues**: High-priority tasks processed first
- **Working Queues**: Temporary storage for in-progress items
- **Queue Operations**: Push, pop, peek, clear operations
- **Queue Analytics**: Size, throughput, processing times

#### 3. File System Abstraction
- **Path Resolution**: Safe path handling within project boundaries
- **File Operations**: Read, write, create, delete operations
- **Directory Operations**: List, create, traverse operations
- **Metadata Access**: File stats, permissions, timestamps

#### 4. Logging System
- **Step Logging**: Operation tracking with conditional execution
- **Log Levels**: Different verbosity levels for different scenarios
- **Log Persistence**: File-based logging with rotation
- **Log Analysis**: Query and analyze operation logs

### Domain Rules

#### Entity Type Rules
1. **task_queue**:
   - Must support priority and working queues
   - Items are strings representing tasks
   - FIFO for same priority level
   - Working queue for temporary storage

2. **id_name**:
   - Bidirectional mapping between IDs and names
   - IDs are unique identifiers
   - Names can be human-readable labels
   - Support for bulk operations

3. **file_struct**:
   - Read-only access to file system
   - Security restrictions on path access
   - Support for various file types
   - Metadata extraction capabilities

#### Security Rules
1. **Path Validation**:
   - All paths must be within project root
   - No directory traversal attacks (../)
   - Whitelist allowed file extensions
   - Validate file permissions before access

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - Atomic operations for file writes
   - Backup before destructive operations
   - Validate data schemas before persistence
   - Handle concurrent access scenarios

#### Performance Rules
1. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Cache frequently accessed entities
   - Invalidate cache on entity changes
   - Memory usage limits for cache
   - Cache hit/miss metrics

2. **Operation Optimization**:
   - Batch related operations
   - Minimize disk I/O operations
   - Use streaming for large files
   - Implement operation queuing

### Domain Boundaries

#### Internal Domain (Core MCP)
- Entity management and persistence
- Queue operations and priority handling
- Step logging and execution tracking
- Schema validation and type safety

#### External Domain (File System)
- Operating system file operations
- Path resolution and security
- File metadata and permissions
- Directory traversal and listing

#### Integration Domain (MCP Protocol)
- JSON-RPC message handling
- Client-server communication
- Resource and tool management
- Error handling and propagation

### Domain Events

#### Entity Events
- `EntityCreated`: New entity initialized
- `EntityRead`: Entity data accessed
- `EntityWritten`: Entity data modified
- `EntityDeleted`: Entity removed

#### Queue Events
- `ItemPushed`: New item added to queue
- `ItemPopped`: Item removed from queue
- `QueueEmpty`: Queue has no items
- `PriorityChanged`: Item priority modified

#### System Events
- `OperationStarted`: MCP operation initiated
- `OperationIN PROGRESS`: MCP operation In Progress
- `ErrorOccurred`: Error during operation
- `LogEntry`: New log entry created

### Domain Services

#### EntityService
- Manages entity lifecycle and operations
- Handles entity persistence and caching
- Validates entity schemas and constraints
- Provides entity query and update APIs

#### QueueService
- Implements queue operations and priorities
- Manages working queue and timeouts
- Provides queue analytics and monitoring
- Handles queue persistence and recovery

#### FileSystemService
- Abstracts file system operations
- Implements security and path validation
- Provides metadata and directory operations
- Handles file watching and change notifications

#### LoggingService
- Manages step logging and execution
- Implements log levels and filtering
- Provides log persistence and rotation
- Supports log querying and analysis
