    Then the epic ID should be included in configuration
    And the theme should reference the custom epic

  Scenario: Create theme with dependencies
    Given a ThemeSetup configuration
    And theme dependencies are specified
    When I execute the theme setup
    Then dependency references should be created
    And the theme should be linked to its dependencies

  Scenario: Initialize base project structure
    Given a BaseSetup configuration
    And project initialization parameters
    When I execute the base setup
    Then the base project structure should be created
    And essential project files should be present
    And configuration templates should be installed

  Scenario: Setup project with Node.js environment
    Given a BaseSetup configuration
    And Node.js environment is specified
    When I execute the base setup
    Then Node.js specific files should be created
    And package.json should be configured
    And Node.js dependencies should be set up

  Scenario: Setup project with Python environment
    Given a BaseSetup configuration
    And Python environment is specified
    When I execute the base setup
    Then Python specific files should be created
    And pyproject.toml should be configured
    And Python dependencies should be set up

  Scenario: Create development environment structure
    Given a BaseSetup configuration for development
    When I execute the base setup
    Then development tools should be configured
    And testing infrastructure should be set up
    And development scripts should be created

  Scenario: Create production environment structure
    Given a BaseSetup configuration for production
    When I execute the base setup
    Then production configurations should be created
    And deployment scripts should be set up
    And production optimizations should be applied

  Scenario: Handle setup errors gracefully
    Given an invalid setup configuration
    When I attempt to execute the setup
    Then it should handle errors gracefully
    And it should provide meaningful error messages
    And it should not leave partial structures

  Scenario: Verify setup integrity after creation
    Given a completed setup
    When I verify the setup integrity
    Then all required files should be present
    And all configurations should be valid
    And the setup should be ready for use

  Scenario: Setup theme with custom templates
    Given a ThemeSetup configuration
    And custom template specifications
    When I execute the theme setup
    Then custom templates should be applied
    And the theme should reflect custom configurations

  Scenario: Create multi-environment setup
    Given a setup configuration for multiple environments
    When I execute the setup
    Then environment-specific configurations should be created
    And each environment should have proper isolation
    And shared resources should be properly referenced

  Scenario: Setup with version control integration
    Given a setup configuration with VCS integration
    When I execute the setup
    Then version control files should be created
    And ignore patterns should be configured
    And repository structure should be initialized

  Scenario: Validate setup prerequisites
    Given setup prerequisites requirements
    When I check the system before setup
    Then all prerequisites should be validated
    And missing requirements should be reported
    And setup should proceed only when ready

  Scenario: Update existing setup structure
    Given an existing setup structure
    And updated setup requirements
    When I execute the setup update
    Then existing files should be preserved
    And new requirements should be added
    And the setup should remain functional
