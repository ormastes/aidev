Feature: Multi Format Report Generation
  As a user of the system
  I want to ensure multi format report generation works correctly
  So that I can rely on the system's functionality

  Scenario: execute real Cucumber tests and generate HTML, JSON, and XML reports
    Given the system is initialized
    When I result
    And I stats
    And I html content
    And I json content
    And I xml content
    And I configure
    And I execute and generate reports
    And I to be
    And I to contain
    And I to have length
    And I some
    And I ends with
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I ends with
    And I to be
    And I some
    And I ends with
    And I to be
    And I stat
    And I is file
    And I to be
    And I to be greater than
    And I find
    And I ends with
    And I read file
    And I to contain
    And I to contain
    And I to contain
    And I find
    And I ends with
    And I read file
    And I parse
    And I to be
    And I to have property
    And I to have property
    And I to have property
    And I find
    And I ends with
    And I read file
    And I to contain
    And I to contain
    And I to contain
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    Then the execute real Cucumber tests and generate HTML, JSON, and XML reports should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle concurrent report generation requests gracefully
    Given the system is initialized
    When I results
    And I stats
    And I map
    And I for each
    And I configure
    And I map
    And I execute and generate reports
    And I all settled
    And I to have length
    And I filter
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I stat
    And I is directory
    And I to be
    And I log
    Then the handle concurrent report generation requests gracefully should complete successfully

  Scenario: validate report file naming conventions and timestamps
    Given the system is initialized
    When I result
    And I stats
    And I configure
    And I now
    And I execute and generate reports
    And I now
    And I split
    And I pop
    And I to contain
    And I to match
    And I to match
    And I stat
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I to be less than or equal
    And I log
    Then the validate report file naming conventions and timestamps should complete successfully

  Scenario: /
    Given the system is initialized
    When I execute test logic
    Then the / should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle error scenarios gracefully and still generate partial reports
    Given the system is initialized
    When I result
    And I json content
    And I test result
    And I report paths
    And I exists
    And I write file
    And I write file
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I configure
    And I execute and generate reports
    And I to be
    And I to have length
    And I find
    And I ends with
    And I read file
    And I parse
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I log
    And I configure
    And I is configured
    And I to be
    And I execute test suite
    And I to be
    And I generate reports
    And I to have length
    And I get configuration
    And I to be
    And I to have property
    And I to have property
    And I get time
    And I to be greater than
    And I get time
    And I access
    And I then
    And I catch
    And I to be
    And I cleanup
    And I is configured
    And I to be
    And I log
    And I log
    And I get time
    And I get time
    Then the handle error scenarios gracefully and still generate partial reports should complete successfully

  Scenario: demonstrate In Progress system workflow from configuration to report delivery
    Given the system is initialized
    When I test result
    And I report paths
    And I exists
    And I configure
    And I is configured
    And I to be
    And I execute test suite
    And I to be
    And I generate reports
    And I to have length
    And I get configuration
    And I to be
    And I to have property
    And I to have property
    And I get time
    And I to be greater than
    And I get time
    And I access
    And I then
    And I catch
    And I to be
    And I cleanup
    And I is configured
    And I to be
    And I log
    And I log
    And I get time
    And I get time
    Then the demonstrate In Progress system workflow from configuration to report delivery should complete successfully
