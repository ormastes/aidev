Feature: Mock Free Test Workflow
  As a user of the system
  I want to ensure mock free test workflow works correctly
  So that I can rely on the system's functionality

  Scenario: execute In Progress Mock Free Test Oriented Development workflow from feature files to reports
    Given the system is initialized
    When I result
    And I file exists
    And I html content
    And I json content
    And I xml content
    And I configure
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I on
    And I push
    And I execute and generate reports
    And I to be defined
    And I to be
    And I to be defined
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be defined
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be defined
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I access
    And I then
    And I catch
    And I to be
    And I find
    And I ends with
    And I read file

    And I to contain
    And I to contain
    And I find
    And I ends with
    And I read file
    And I parse
    And I to be
    And I to be defined
    And I to be defined
    And I find
    And I ends with
    And I read file
    And I to contain
    And I to contain
    And I to contain
    And I to be greater than
    And I map
    And I to contain
    And I to contain
    And I to contain
    And I index of
    And I index of
    And I to be less than
    Then the execute In Progress Mock Free Test Oriented Development workflow from feature files to reports should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle external log library integration throughout workflow
    Given the system is initialized
    When I result
    And I configure
    And I initialize log library
    And I on
    And I push
    And I execute and generate reports
    And I to be defined
    And I to be defined
    And I is array
    And I to be
    And I to be greater than
    And I to have property
    And I to have property
    And I to have property
    And I to be
    Then the handle external log library integration throughout workflow should complete successfully

  Scenario: handle workflow errors gracefully and generate error reports
    Given the system is initialized
    When I result
    And I configure
    And I on
    And I includes
    And I push
    And I execute and generate reports
    And I to be
    And I to be defined
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be defined
    And I to be greater than
    And I to be greater than
    Then the handle workflow errors gracefully and generate error reports should complete successfully

  Scenario: support workflow cancellation and cleanup
    Given the system is initialized
    When I result
    And I configure
    And I execute and generate reports
    And I cancel
    And I to be
    And I to contain
    And I is running
    And I to be
    Then the support workflow cancellation and cleanup should complete successfully

  Scenario: demonstrate In Progress Story Reporter capabilities
    Given the system is initialized
    When I result
    And I configure
    And I initialize log library
    And I for each
    And I on
    And I push
    And I execute and generate reports
    And I to be defined
    And I to be defined
    And I to be defined
    And I to be
    And I to be defined
    And I to be defined
    And I to be defined
    And I to be greater than or equal
    And I some
    And I includes
    And I to be
    And I to be defined
    And I to be defined
    And I to be greater than
    And I map
    And I to contain
