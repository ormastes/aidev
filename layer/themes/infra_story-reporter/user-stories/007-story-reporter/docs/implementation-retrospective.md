   - **Resolution**: Designed for forward compatibility, tests structure ready

2. **Event System Complexity**
   - **Issue**: Complex event coordination across components
   - **Impact**: Some event emission tests failing
   - **Resolution**: Partial - needs event timing refinement

3. **External Process Management**
   - **Issue**: Managing Cucumber.js subprocess lifecycle
   - **Impact**: Timeout and cancellation handling complexity
   - **Resolution**: In Progress but needs refinement

4. **Error Propagation**
   - **Issue**: Ensuring errors propagate correctly through layers
   - **Impact**: Some error handling tests failing
   - **Resolution**: Partial - needs error message standardization

### Design Challenges

1. **Configuration Complexity**
   - **Issue**: Balancing flexibility with simplicity
   - **Impact**: Large configuration interfaces
   - **Resolution**: Used defaults and validation

2. **Report Format Abstraction**
