Feature: User Authentication
  As a user
  I want to authenticate to the system
  So that I can access protected resources

  Scenario: Successful login
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter valid credentials
    And I click the login button
    Then I should be redirected to the dashboard
    And I should see a welcome message

  Scenario: Failed login with invalid credentials
    Given I am on the login page
    When I enter invalid credentials
    And I click the login button
    Then I should see an error message
    And I should remain on the login page
