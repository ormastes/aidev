# Portal and User Interface Epic

## Overview

The Portal Epic provides comprehensive web-based user interface capabilities for the AI Development Platform. It consolidates portal functionality, GUI selection tools, and security features into a unified epic that manages all web-facing components.

## Purpose

This epic serves as the central hub for all portal and UI-related themes, providing:
- Web portal interfaces for user interaction
- GUI design and selection capabilities
- Security and authentication services
- Session management and authorization

## Child Themes

### portal_aidev
- **Purpose**: Main AI Development Portal
- **Key Features**:
  - User authentication and registration
  - Project dashboard and management
  - API integration interfaces
  - User profile management
  - Real-time collaboration features

### portal_gui-selector
- **Purpose**: GUI design selection and preview system
- **Key Features**:
  - Multiple design candidate generation
  - Live preview server (localhost:3456)
  - Design selection interface
  - ASCII sketch to GUI conversion
  - Accessibility and theme options

### portal_security
- **Purpose**: Web security and authentication layer
- **Key Features**:
  - Authentication service (AuthService)
  - Session management (SessionManager)
  - Security middleware for requests
  - Token service for API access
  - Port management for multi-app deployment
  - Credential storage and management

## Architecture

Following HEA (Hierarchical Encapsulation Architecture) principles:
- Each theme maintains strict boundaries
- Cross-theme communication through defined interfaces
- Security enforced at multiple layers
- Modular and replaceable components

## Integration Points

- **llm-agent epic**: Security for agent communications
- **infra epic**: Logging and monitoring integration
- **check epic**: Security validation and compliance
- **init epic**: Configuration and setup integration

## Usage

### Portal Access
```bash
# Start the main portal
npm run start:portal

# Access at http://localhost:3000
```

### GUI Selection
```bash
# Start GUI selector
npm run start:gui-selector

# Access at http://localhost:3456
```

### Security Configuration
```javascript
// Example security setup
import { AuthService, SessionManager } from '@aidev/portal_security';

const auth = new AuthService();
const sessions = new SessionManager();

// Configure authentication
auth.configure({
  tokenExpiry: '24h',
  refreshEnabled: true
});
```

## Best Practices

1. **Security First**: All portal components must implement proper authentication
2. **Session Management**: Use centralized session management for all portal apps
3. **GUI Standards**: Follow established design patterns for consistency
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure all portal interfaces meet accessibility standards
5. **Performance**: Optimize for fast load times and responsive interfaces
