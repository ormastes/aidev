Feature: Plugins Hooks
  As a system tester
  I want to validate plugins hooks
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should register and initialize plugins
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should register and initialize plugins
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should allow plugins to modify existing commands
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should allow plugins to modify existing commands
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should enable plugin communication via shared context
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should enable plugin communication via shared context
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |

  @automated @system
  Scenario: should implement file system plugin with real I/O
    Given I perform readFile on fs
    When I perform readdir on fs
    Then the operation should complete successfully

  @manual
  Scenario: Manual validation of should implement file system plugin with real I/O
    Given the tester has access to the system
    When the tester manually executes the test steps:
      | Step | Action | Expected Result |
      | 1 | I perform readFile on fs | Action completes successfully |
      | 2 | I perform readdir on fs | Action completes successfully |
    Then verify all assertions pass:
      | Assertion | Expected |
