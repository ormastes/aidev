Feature: Cli Full Application
  As a system tester
  I want to validate cli full application
  So that I can ensure system reliability

  Background:
    Given the test environment is initialized
    And all required services are running

      | Assertion | Expected |
      | result.exitCode should be 0 | Pass |
      | result.stdout should match /\d+\.\d+\.\d+/ | Pass |
      | result.stderr should be  | Pass |
