Feature: Plugins Hooks
  As a user of the system
  I want to ensure plugins hooks works correctly
  So that I can rely on the system's functionality

  Scenario: \n
    Given the system is initialized
    When I execute script
    And I output
    And I join
    And I cwd
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I log
    And I add hook
    And I log
    And I register
    And I get definition
    And I register
    And I run
    And I slice
    And I catch
    And I error
    And I exit
    And I write file
    And I to contain
    And I to contain
    And I to contain
    And I to contain
    And I to contain
    Then the \n should complete successfully
