# Code Quality and Architecture Check Epic

## Overview

The check epic provides comprehensive code quality checking, architecture validation, and development methodology enforcement for the AI Development Platform. It ensures consistent code quality, proper architecture patterns, and adherence to development best practices.

## Purpose

This epic serves as the central hub for all code quality and validation themes, providing:
- Code enhancement and formatting
- Architecture pattern validation
- Development methodology enforcement
- Quality assurance tools

## Child Themes

### check_code-enhancer
- Code formatting and beautification
- Code quality improvements
- Style consistency enforcement
- Automated code refactoring suggestions

### check_hea-architecture
- Hierarchical Encapsulation Architecture (HEA) validation
- Project structure compliance checking
- Layer separation enforcement
- Pipe gateway validation

### check_mock-free-test-oriented
- Mock Free Test Oriented Development (MFTOD) enforcement
- Test-first development validation
- Real implementation testing
- Coverage and quality metrics

## Key Features

1. **Automated Code Quality Checks**
   - Style validation
   - Complexity analysis
   - Best practices enforcement
   - Security vulnerability detection

2. **Architecture Compliance**
   - HEA pattern validation
   - Module boundary enforcement
   - Dependency graph analysis
   - Cross-layer access prevention

3. **Testing Methodology**
   - MFTOD compliance checking
   - Test coverage validation
   - Test quality assessment
   - Integration test verification

## Usage

The check epic themes are typically integrated into:
- CI/CD pipelines for automated validation
- Pre-commit hooks for early detection
- Development workflows for continuous feedback
- Code review processes for quality assurance

## Integration Points

- **fraud-checker**: Validates test authenticity
- **coverage-aggregator**: Provides coverage metrics
- **story-reporter**: Reports validation results
- **dev-environment**: Integrates with development tools

## Best Practices

1. Run checks early and often
2. Fix issues immediately when detected
3. Configure appropriate rules for your project
4. Use incremental checking for large codebases
5. Integrate with IDE for real-time feedback
