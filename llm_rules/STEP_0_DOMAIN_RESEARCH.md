# Step 0: Domain Research

## Purpose

Establish deep understanding of the problem domain before implementation begins.

## Activities

### Research Phase

- **Understand the domain** terminology and concepts

- **Identify stakeholders** and their needs

- **Document assumptions** and constraints

- **Research existing solutions** and patterns

### Analysis Deliverables

1. **Domain Model**
  - Core entities and relationships
  - Business rules and constraints
  - Terminology glossary

2. **Technology Assessment**
  - Available tools and frameworks
  - Integration requirements
  - Performance considerations

3. **Risk Analysis**
  - Technical risks
  - Business risks
  - Mitigation strategies

## Outputs

- Domain research document

- Technology selection rationale

- Risk assessment matrix

- Initial architecture proposal

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Domain model reviewed and approved

- [ ] Technology choices validated

- [ ] Risks identified and documented

- [ ] Architecture approach defined
