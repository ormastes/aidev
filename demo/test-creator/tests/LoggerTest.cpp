Okay, I need to create a comprehensive test file for the Logger class using Google Test framework in C++. The user has provided the header and some basic methods, so I'll start by understanding what each method does.

First, looking at the Logger class, it has constructors, destructor, logging methods (log, debug, info, warning, error), setting log level, getting log level, recent logs retrieval, clearing logs, checking if enabled, and enabling or disabling.

Since the tests should be mock-less, I can't use test doubles. Instead, I'll create real Logger instances and rely on their default constructors to initialize properly. But wait, the constructor has a parameter with a default value of an empty string. So when creating Logger objects in tests, they might not have log filenames set unless specified.

Hmm, but for testing logging functionality, maybe it's better if each test creates its own Logger instance and sets up the necessary paths or mocks. However, since we can't use mocks, perhaps using a temporary file name would be acceptable for unit testing purposes.

Wait, no, because in production code, the log filename is provided by the user. So in tests, maybe I should set it to a temporary path that exists during testing. Alternatively, if the Logger uses an empty string as default, which might not create any logs unless explicitly told to do so.

But for testing logging methods, perhaps we can proceed without worrying about the log file since they are just strings. So each test case will create a Logger instance and call various logging methods to see if they work correctly.

Now, considering Google Test's structure, I'll need to write TTest classes with SetUp and TearDown methods. Each test case should cover different scenarios for the public methods of Logger.

Let me outline the tests:

1. Basic constructor and destructor: Check if Logger is created and destroyed properly.
2. Logging without enabled: Ensure that when isEnabled() is false, logging methods do nothing or throw an error? Looking at the code, the log method doesn't check if enabled. Wait, no—Logger's log method isn't checking enabled because in the header, it's not marked as protected. So perhaps the Logger class has an isEnabled() method but the log methods don't use it. That might be a bug, but for testing purposes, I'll proceed.

Wait, looking at the code:

The Logger has isEnabled() const, so probably the logging methods should check if enabled before doing anything. Otherwise, they would always write logs regardless of the enable state. So that's an issue in the design. But since it's a test file, perhaps we can assume that the log methods are called when enabled.

Alternatively, maybe I should modify the Logger to have an isEnabled() method and make all logging methods check this before writing. But since the user didn't mention changing the code, I'll proceed with testing as per the current implementation.

So for each test case:

- Test log() without any parameters: Ensure it's called correctly.
- Test log() with different levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR).
- Test setting the level before logging and ensure it affects subsequent logs.
- Test getting the current level.
- Test retrieving recent logs—make sure that getRecentLogs returns a vector of strings. Also, check if clearing logs empties the vector.
- Test enabling and disabling: Ensure that when enabled is set to false, logging doesn't occur.

Wait, but in the Logger class, the log methods don't check isEnabled(). So perhaps they should be modified to throw an error or do nothing when not enabled. But since I can't change the code, maybe I'll have to assume that the tests are run with the logger enabled unless specified otherwise.

Alternatively, if the tests need to handle the enable state, then in each test case, we might set the level and enable state as needed.

But perhaps it's better to proceed under the assumption that when the log methods are called, the Logger is enabled. So I'll create test cases where the logger is enabled unless necessary.

Now, considering all this, I'll structure the tests:

1. Test constructor: Check if Logger is created and destructor properly cleans up.
2. Test logging with different levels: Ensure each level method calls log() correctly.
3. Test setting current_level before logging to ensure it affects subsequent logs.
4. Test getLogLevel() after setting a level.
5. Test recentLogs(): Make sure that the vector has the correct number of logs and that clearing logs works.
6. Test isEnabled() and setEnabled() methods: Ensure they work as expected.

I'll structure each test case within a TTest class, using SetUp to create Logger instances with specific parameters where needed (like setting log filenames or enabling logging).

Wait, but for testing the log file functionality, perhaps I need to have an actual file path. So in the test environment, there should be a temporary file that can be used as the log filename.

Alternatively, if the log_filename is empty by default, then when the logger tries to write logs, it might not do anything unless told to use a specific file. But since we're using real objects, perhaps I need to set the log_filename in each test case's SetUp method.

But that could complicate things because different tests would have different log filenames. Alternatively, maybe create a temporary directory and set the log_filename to a path within it.

Wait, but for unit testing, it's better to use a single file or a known location. So perhaps I'll assume that the Logger uses an empty string as default, which might not write any logs unless explicitly told to do so. But in our tests, we can create Logger instances and call log() methods without worrying about whether they actually write to a file.

Wait no—looking at the code, when you call log(), it's supposed to write to a file named "log_filename". So if the default is an empty string, then perhaps the logger doesn't write any logs unless told otherwise. But that might be a bug in the design because the log methods don't check if the log_filename is set.

So perhaps I should modify my test cases to ensure that when we call log(), it actually writes to a file with a specific name. Therefore, in each test case's SetUp method, I'll create a temporary file and set log_filename to its path.

But since this is a mock-less test, the tests will rely on real behavior. So if the Logger uses an empty string by default, then when we call log(), it might not write anything unless told to do so. But that's probably beyond our control as we're using real objects.

Alternatively, perhaps in the test environment, the user has set up a specific log file path. For example, maybe they have a "test.log" file somewhere. So I can assume that when Logger is created with an empty string, it uses this file.

But for the sake of testing, perhaps each test case will create its own Logger instance and manage the log file accordingly.

Wait, but in C++, if we don't set the log_filename, then the logger might not write to any file. So in our tests, when we call log(), unless we have a log_filename set, it won't do anything. Therefore, perhaps I should create a temporary file path and set log_filename to that during SetUp.

So in each test case's SetUp:

- Create a temporary file (like "test1.log", "test2.log", etc.)
- Set Logger::log_filename to this file's path.
- Then perform the logging operations.

But since this is a unit test, perhaps it's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe I can use a static file that exists in the test directory.

Alternatively, perhaps for simplicity, each test case will create its own Logger instance and set log_filename appropriately.

Wait, but if the default is an empty string, then when we call log(), unless the logger has been told to write to a specific file, it won't do anything. So maybe I should modify the Logger's constructor to accept a filename by default as something like "logs/logger.log" or similar. But that's beyond our control.

Hmm, perhaps for testing purposes, each test case will create its own Logger instance and set log_filename to a temporary path during SetUp.

Alternatively, since this is getting complicated, maybe I can proceed with the tests without worrying about the log file functionality, as it might be outside the scope of unit testing. Instead, focus on the methods that manipulate the log levels, get recent logs, etc.

Wait, but in the test cases provided by the user, they have a sample test file which is empty. So perhaps I should proceed to write tests for all public methods, including logging, setting level, getting level, recent logs, clear logs, enabled status, and enable/disable.

So each test case will cover one or more of these scenarios.

Now, considering that, I'll structure the TTest class with multiple test cases:

- Test constructor and destructor.
- Test log() method with different levels.
- Test setting current_level before logging.
- Test getLogLevel().
- Test recentLogs() including edge cases like count=0.
- Test clearLogs().
- Test isEnabled() and setEnabled().

Each of these will be separate test cases within the TTest class, each in its own SetUp and TearDown methods if necessary. But since TTest uses signals, perhaps it's better to structure them as individual test cases without signal-based teardown.

Wait, no—TTest can have multiple test cases using different signals or just a single test case with multiple parts.

Alternatively, I'll create a TTest class with multiple test cases, each covering specific functionality.

So in the final test file, I'll include all these test cases, ensuring that each method is tested thoroughly.

I'll also
