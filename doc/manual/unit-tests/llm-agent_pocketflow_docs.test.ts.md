## Test Overview

### Test Suites

- Architecture Documentation

## Test Cases

### 1. all required documentation files exist

#### Purpose
This test verifies: all required documentation files exist

#### Prerequisites
- Required test data is available
- Dependencies are properly mocked/configured

#### Test Steps
1. **Setup**: Initialize test context
2. **Arrange**: Prepare test data and conditions
3. **Act**: Execute the operation being tested

#### Expected Results
- The operation completes successfully
- All assertions pass
- No unexpected side effects occur

#### Manual Execution
When running manually:
- [ ] Verify prerequisites are met
- [ ] Execute test steps in order
- [ ] Validate expected results
- [ ] Document any deviations

### 4. cross-references are valid

#### Purpose
This test verifies: cross-references are valid

#### Prerequisites
- Required test data is available
- Dependencies are properly mocked/configured

#### Test Steps
1. **Setup**: Initialize test context
2. **Arrange**: Prepare test data and conditions
3. **Act**: Execute the operation being tested
4. **Assert**: Verify the expected outcome

#### Expected Results
- The operation completes successfully

## Environment Setup

### Dependencies
```bash
npm install  # Install all dependencies
npm run build  # Build the project
```

### Configuration
- Ensure test configuration is properly set
- Environment variables are configured
- Test database/storage is initialized

## Execution Instructions

### Automated Execution
```bash
# Run this specific test file
npm test -- docs.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage -- docs.test.ts

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch docs.test.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Test timeout | Slow async operations | Increase timeout value |
| Module not found | Missing dependencies | Run npm install |
| Connection refused | Service not running | Start required services |
| Assertion failed | Logic error or data issue | Debug test implementation |

## Suggested Improvements

Based on quality analysis, consider:

- Add Given-When-Then comments for better documentation
- Consider adding timeout configurations for long-running tests
