## Execution Instructions

### Automated Execution
```bash
# Run this specific test file
npm test -- log-rotation-service.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage -- log-rotation-service.test.ts

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch log-rotation-service.test.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Test timeout | Slow async operations | Increase timeout value |
| Module not found | Missing dependencies | Run npm install |
