## Execution Instructions

### Automated Execution
```bash
# Run this specific test file
npm test -- statistics-analyzer-edge-cases.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage -- statistics-analyzer-edge-cases.test.ts

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch statistics-analyzer-edge-cases.test.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Test timeout | Slow async operations | Increase timeout value |
| Module not found | Missing dependencies | Run npm install |
| Connection refused | Service not running | Start required services |
| Assertion failed | Logic error or data issue | Debug test implementation |

## Suggested Improvements

Based on quality analysis, consider:
