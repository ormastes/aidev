## Execution Instructions

### Automated Execution
```bash
# Run this specific test file
npm test -- mock-free-test-runner-event-emission-coverage.test.ts

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage -- mock-free-test-runner-event-emission-coverage.test.ts

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch mock-free-test-runner-event-emission-coverage.test.ts
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Test timeout | Slow async operations | Increase timeout value |
| Module not found | Missing dependencies | Run npm install |
| Connection refused | Service not running | Start required services |
| Assertion failed | Logic error or data issue | Debug test implementation |

## Suggested Improvements

Based on quality analysis, consider:

- Add Given-When-Then comments for better documentation
- Some test names are too short - add more descriptive names
