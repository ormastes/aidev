## System Test Execution Guide

### Prerequisites

1. **Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Service Dependencies**
   - Start all required services
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Check database availability

3. **Test Data**
   - Initialize test database
   - Load test fixtures
   - Configure test accounts

### Running System Tests

#### Run All System Tests
```bash
npm run test:system
```

#### Run Specific Test File
```bash
npm test -- tests/system/<test-file>.systest.ts
```

#### Run with Coverage
```bash
npm run test:system:coverage
```

#### Run in Debug Mode
```bash
node --inspect-brk ./node_modules/.bin/jest tests/system
```

### Test Execution Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] All dependencies installed
- [ ] Services are running
- [ ] Test database is clean
- [ ] Network connectivity verified
- [ ] Logging configured for debugging
- [ ] Test timeout settings appropriate

### Interpreting Results

#### Success Indicators
- All tests pass (green)
- No console errors
- Expected logs generated
- Performance within thresholds

#### Failure Investigation
1. Check error messages and stack traces
2. Review system logs
3. Verify test data state
4. Check service connectivity
5. Validate environment configuration

### Manual Verification

When running tests manually, verify:
1. **Functional Correctness**: Does the feature work as expected?
2. **Data Integrity**: Is data correctly stored/retrieved?
3. **Error Handling**: Are errors properly caught and reported?
4. **Performance**: Are response times acceptable?
5. **Security**: Are security measures effective?

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Test timeout | Slow network/service | Increase timeout settings |
| Connection refused | Service not running | Start required services |
| Data conflicts | Dirty test database | Reset database before tests |
| Permission denied | Insufficient privileges | Check user permissions |
| Module not found | Missing dependencies | Run npm install |

### Debug Strategies

1. **Isolate the Test**: Run single test in isolation
2. **Add Logging**: Increase log verbosity
3. **Check State**: Verify pre/post conditions
4. **Step Through**: Use debugger to step through code
5. **Review Changes**: Check recent code changes

## Best Practices

1. **Test Independence**: Each test should be independent
2. **Clean State**: Always start with clean test environment
3. **Meaningful Names**: Use descriptive test names
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test happy path and edge cases
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Track test execution time
6. **Documentation**: Keep test documentation updated
