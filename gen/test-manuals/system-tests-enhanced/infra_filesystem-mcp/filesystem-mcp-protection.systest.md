## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- All dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- Test database/storage initialized
- Environment variables configured

### Configuration
```bash
# Set up test environment
export NODE_ENV=test
export TEST_THEME=infra_filesystem-mcp

# Initialize test data
npm run test:setup
```

## Running the Test

### Automated Execution
```bash
# Run this specific test
npm test -- filesystem-mcp-protection.systest.ts

# Run with debugging
node --inspect-brk ./node_modules/.bin/jest filesystem-mcp-protection.systest.ts
```

### Manual Execution
1. Open the test file: `/home/ormastes/dev/pub/aidev/layer/themes/infra_filesystem-mcp/tests/system/filesystem-mcp-protection.systest.ts`
2. Review the test implementation
3. Execute each step manually
4. Verify expected outcomes
5. Document results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
