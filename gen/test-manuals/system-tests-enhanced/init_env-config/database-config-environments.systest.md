# Set up test environment
export NODE_ENV=test
export TEST_THEME=init_env-config

# Initialize test data
npm run test:setup
```

## Running the Test

### Automated Execution
```bash
# Run this specific test
npm test -- database-config-environments.systest.ts

# Run with debugging
node --inspect-brk ./node_modules/.bin/jest database-config-environments.systest.ts
```

### Manual Execution
1. Open the test file: `/home/ormastes/dev/pub/aidev/layer/themes/init_env-config/user-stories/026-auto-env-generation/tests/scenarios/database-config-environments.systest.ts`
2. Review the test implementation
3. Execute each step manually
4. Verify expected outcomes
5. Document results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Test timeout | Increase timeout in jest config |
| Connection error | Verify services are running |
