## Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- All dependencies installed (`npm install`)
- Test database/storage initialized
- Environment variables configured

### Configuration
```bash
# Set up test environment
export NODE_ENV=test
export TEST_THEME=llm-agent_coordinator-claude

# Initialize test data
npm run test:setup
```

## Running the Test

### Automated Execution
```bash
# Run this specific test
npm test -- coordinator-comprehensive-system.test.ts

# Run with debugging
node --inspect-brk ./node_modules/.bin/jest coordinator-comprehensive-system.test.ts
```

### Manual Execution
1. Open the test file: `/home/ormastes/dev/pub/aidev/layer/themes/llm-agent_coordinator-claude/user-stories/010-coordinator-agent/tests/system/coordinator-comprehensive-system.test.ts`
2. Review the test implementation
