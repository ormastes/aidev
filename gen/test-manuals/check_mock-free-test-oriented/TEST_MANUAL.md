### System Tests


## Testing Procedures

### Environment Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Configure environment variables
3. Initialize test database (if applicable)
4. Start required services

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run unit tests only
npm run test:unit

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run system tests
npm run test:system

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Data Management

- Test data location: `tests/fixtures/`
- Mock data: `tests/mocks/`
- Test configuration: `tests/config/`

### Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run on:
- Pull request creation
- Push to main branch
- Nightly builds

## Coverage Requirements

- **Unit Test Coverage**: Minimum 90%
- **Integration Test Coverage**: Minimum 80%
- **System Test Coverage**: Critical paths only

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Test Timeout**
   - Increase timeout in test configuration
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify service availability

2. **Test Data Issues**
   - Reset test database
   - Clear test cache
   - Regenerate fixtures

3. **Environment Issues**
   - Verify environment variables
   - Check service configurations
   - Review dependency versions
