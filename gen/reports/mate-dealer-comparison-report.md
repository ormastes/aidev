- Multiple screen selection templates:
  - Profile selection
  - Dashboard selection
  - Broker area selection
  - Style selection
  - Animation effects selection

### Web Demo
- Direct integration with AI Dev Portal GUI selector
- Template application via API
- Real-time style updates
- Stored at `http://localhost:3456`

## Architecture Patterns

### React Native (HEA Architecture)
```
src/
├── domain/          # Business logic
├── infrastructure/  # External services
├── presentation/    # UI components
└── pipe/           # Cross-layer gateways
```

### Web Demo
- Traditional MVC pattern
- Simpler structure
- Direct API calls

## Unique Features Comparison

### React Native Exclusive
1. **Dual-mode architecture** (Server/Serverless)
2. **External logging system** with comprehensive tracking
3. **Native platform integration**
4. **Gesture navigation**
5. **Performance monitoring**
6. **Debug tools** with in-app log viewer

### Web Demo Exclusive
1. **Direct GUI selector integration**
2. **Browser-based features**
3. **Simpler deployment**
4. **Cross-platform by default**

## Development Workflow Integration

### React Native

3. **Search and Filtering** - Enhanced dealer discovery
4. **Profile Management** - User profile editing
5. **Error Boundaries** - Better error handling

### Medium Priority
1. **Performance Monitoring** - Track web vitals
2. **Offline Support** - Service worker implementation
3. **Advanced Dashboard** - Analytics and insights
4. **Inventory Management** - Complete CRUD operations

### Low Priority
1. **Animations** - Enhanced user experience
2. **Dark Mode** - Theme switching
3. **Localization** - Multi-language support

## Integration Opportunities

1. **Shared API**: Both apps could use the same backend
2. **Component Library**: Share UI components via web components
3. **Testing Strategy**: Unified E2E testing approach
4. **GUI Templates**: Share design systems between platforms

## Conclusion
