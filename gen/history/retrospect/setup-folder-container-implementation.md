- Unified deployment management
- Configuration-driven deployments
- Health monitoring and reporting

### 4. Developer Experience
- Intuitive CLI with interactive mode
- Project scaffolding for multiple languages
- Comprehensive help documentation
- Multiple output formats for automation

## Integration Points

### 1. Theme Integration
- Seamless integration with `init_docker` theme features
- Full compatibility with `init_qemu` theme capabilities
- Utilizes filesystem-mcp for configuration management

### 2. Development Workflow
- Supports hot reload for rapid development
- Debug mode with appropriate port exposure
- Volume mounting for code synchronization
- Environment-specific configurations

### 3. Production Readiness
- Resource limits and reservations
