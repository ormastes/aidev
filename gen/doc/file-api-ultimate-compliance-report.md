## 🔒 Enforcement Mechanisms

### 1. Git Pre-commit Hooks ✅
```bash
# Installed and active
npm run file-api:hooks:install
```

### 2. CI/CD Integration Ready
```yaml
- name: Enforce File API Compliance
  run: |
    violations=$(npm run file-api:scan:prod | grep "Total violations:" | awk '{print $3}')
    if [ "$violations" -gt "30" ]; then
      echo "New violations detected!"
      exit 1
    fi
```

### 3. Runtime Enforcement Available
```javascript
// Enable in production
process.env.ENFORCE_FILE_API = 'enforce';
```

## 📋 Remaining 24 Violations

### By Component (3.6% of original)
- **init_setup-folder**: 7 violations (3 files)
- **scripts**: 6 violations (3 files)
- **infra_scripts**: 3 violations (1 file)
- **infra_python-coverage**: 2 violations (1 file)
- **Other**: 6 violations (6 files)

### Why These Remain
1. **Complex callback patterns** not easily automated
2. **Script files** that modify themselves
3. **Legacy integration points** requiring manual review
4. **Third-party library constraints**
