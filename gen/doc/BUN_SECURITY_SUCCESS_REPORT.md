### 3. Enhanced Fraud Detection System

Created `FraudCheckerServiceSecure.ts` with:
- **7 fraud detection rules** (rapid fire, suspicious IP, velocity checks, etc.)
- **Real-time IP blocking** for critical threats
- **Privacy-first design** - automatic PII removal
- **Rate-limited fraud API** (10 checks/minute)
- **Admin controls** for manual IP management

### 4. Updated Components

#### GUI Selector Portal (`/release/gui-selector-portal/`)
- ✅ All security middleware applied
- ✅ CSRF protection on all forms
- ✅ Secure admin setup script
- ✅ Rate limiting on all endpoints
- ✅ Input sanitization active

## 📝 Fraud Detection Features

### Detection Rules
1. **Rapid Fire**: Detects <500ms between actions
2. **Suspicious IP**: Tracks and blocks bad actors
3. **Velocity Check**: Monitors abnormal activity rates
4. **Pattern Detection**: Identifies attack patterns
5. **Impossible Travel**: Geographic impossibility checks
6. **Account Takeover**: Detects ATO signals
7. **Blocked IP**: Immediate rejection of banned IPs

### Privacy Features
- Automatic PII removal from logs
- Sanitized error responses
- No sensitive data in fraud checks
- Configurable thresholds via environment

## 🔧 Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=<secure-random-string>

# Optional
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3456
NODE_ENV=production
FRAUD_VELOCITY_THRESHOLD=10
FRAUD_BLOCK_DURATION=3600000
```
