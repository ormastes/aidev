### ⚠️ Already Had TypeScript Versions (29 files)
Most files in `infra_external-log-lib` already had TypeScript versions alongside JavaScript files.

## Files That Should Remain as JavaScript

### 1. Configuration Files (Must stay as .js)
These files are expected by tools to be in JavaScript format:
- `jest.config.js` files
- `cucumber.js` files
- `webpack.config.js` files
- `playwright.config.js` files
- `.eslintrc.js` files

### 2. Browser/Client-Side Scripts
Files in public directories that run in browsers:
- `*/public/js/*.js` - Client-side JavaScript files
- `*/demo/*/public/js/app.js` - Demo application scripts
- HTML embedded scripts

### 3. Test Fixtures and Mock Applications
- Test helper applications (e.g., `test-memory-leak-app.js`)
- Mock servers and fixtures
- Example/demo scripts

### 4. Database Configuration Files
- `*/config/database.js` - Database configuration files used by runtime

### 5. Generated/Third-Party Files
- `prism.js` - Syntax highlighting library
- Generated files in temp directories

## Categories of Remaining JavaScript Files (170 total)

### By Location:
1. **Demo/Release folders** (~80 files)
   - Public browser scripts
   - Database configs
   - Release artifacts

2. **Test fixtures** (~20 files)
   - Mock applications
   - Test helpers
   - System test apps

3. **Configuration** (~10 files)
   - Build configs
   - Test configs
   - Tool configs

4. **Scripts and utilities** (~60 files)
   - Demo scripts
   - Test scripts
   - Utility scripts

## Recommendations

### Files That Could Be Converted (but low priority):
1. Non-public demo scripts
2. Internal test utilities
3. Build scripts

### Files That MUST Stay as JavaScript:
1. All `jest.config.js` files
2. All `cucumber.js` files
3. Browser-side scripts in `public/` directories
4. External libraries (like `prism.js`)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Core library code has been converted to TypeScript
2. ✅ Test files have been converted where appropriate
3. ✅ Service and utility modules are now in TypeScript

The remaining JavaScript files are primarily:
- Configuration files (required by tools)
- Browser scripts (client-side code)
- Demo/release artifacts
- Test fixtures

No further conversion is necessary as the main source code is now in TypeScript.
