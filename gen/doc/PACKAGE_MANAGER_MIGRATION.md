# Package Manager Migration Report

## Date: 2025-08-15

## Summary
Successfully migrated the AI Development Platform from traditional package managers to modern, faster alternatives:
- **JavaScript**: npm → bun
- **Python**: pip → uv

## Changes Made

### JavaScript Migration (npm → bun)
- **Installed**: bun v1.2.20
- **Migration Script**: `/scripts/migrate-npm-to-bun.sh`
- **Files Updated**: 589+ files containing npm references
- **Lock File**: Converted `package-lock.json` to `bun.lockb`

### Python Migration (pip → uv)
- **Installed**: uv v0.8.8 (already present)
- **Migration Script**: `/scripts/migrate-pip-to-uv.sh`
- **Files Updated**: All pip/pip3 references replaced with `uv pip`
- **Environment**: Using Python 3.11.13 at `/home/ormastes/dev/aidev/.venv`

## Benefits

### Bun Advantages
- **Speed**: Up to 30x faster package installation
- **Compatibility**: Drop-in replacement for npm
- **Built-in**: TypeScript support, bundler, test runner
- **Memory**: Lower memory usage during installation

### UV Advantages
- **Speed**: 10-100x faster than pip
- **Resolution**: More reliable dependency resolution
- **Caching**: Better package caching
- **Compatibility**: Works with existing pip commands via `uv pip`

## Usage

### JavaScript/TypeScript
```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Run scripts
bun run test
bun run build
bun run dev

# Add packages
bun add <package>
bun add -D <dev-package>
```

### Python
```bash
# Install dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install package
uv pip install <package>

# List packages
uv pip list

# Freeze requirements
uv pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Verification
- ✅ Bun successfully installed and managing JavaScript dependencies
- ✅ UV successfully managing Python packages
- ✅ All npm references updated to bun
- ✅ All pip references updated to uv
- ✅ Migration scripts created for future use

## Notes
- Some Jest test configurations may need adjustment for full bun test runner compatibility
- Both package managers are backward compatible with their predecessors
- Migration scripts are idempotent and can be safely re-run if needed

## Rollback (if needed)
To rollback to npm/pip:
1. Remove `bun.lockb`
2. Restore `package-lock.json` from version control
3. Run the reverse migration scripts (would need to be created)
4. Reinstall dependencies with npm/pip

## Conclusion
The migration to bun and uv provides significant performance improvements for package management operations, reducing developer wait times and CI/CD pipeline duration.
