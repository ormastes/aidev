# Testing Status Report

## Date: 2025-08-16

## Summary
All system tests have been successfully migrated from `.stest.ts` format to Cucumber `.feature` format. However, there is a Node.js version compatibility issue that needs to be resolved.

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Test Infrastructure Migration**
   - Merged `layer/shared/test-infrastructure` → `layer/shared/test`
   - Updated all imports and references
   - Package renamed from `@aidev/test-infrastructure` to `@aidev/test`

2. **System Test Migration to Cucumber**
   - Converted 42 `.stest.ts` files to Cucumber format
   - Created 101+ `.feature` files with corresponding step definitions
   - Removed all legacy `.stest.ts` files and compiled outputs
   - Created `cucumber.yml` configuration with multiple profiles

3. **Dependencies**
   - Cucumber installed: `@cucumber/cucumber@^12.0.0`
   - Chai installed: `chai@^5.2.1` for assertions
   - All necessary testing libraries in place

4. **Scripts and Tools**
   - Created Node.js upgrade script: `scripts/upgrade-nodejs.sh`
   - Created Bun-based runner: `scripts/bun-cucumber-runner.ts`
   - Created combined solution: `scripts/run-cucumber-with-bun.sh`
   - Added npm scripts for various test execution methods

### ⚠️ Pending Issue
**Node.js Version Requirement**
- Current version: v18.19.1
- Required version: v20+ for Cucumber
- Impact: Cannot run Cucumber tests directly

## Available Solutions

### Option 1: Upgrade Node.js (Recommended)
Run the upgrade script:
```bash
./scripts/upgrade-nodejs.sh
```
This provides multiple installation methods:
- NVM (Node Version Manager)
- System package manager (apt/brew)
- Direct download
- Other version managers (n, fnm)

### Option 2: Alternative Test Runners
While Node.js upgrade is pending, consider:
1. **Jest-based runner**: `scripts/run-system-tests-jest.ts`
2. **Bun workarounds**: `scripts/run-cucumber-with-bun.sh`

## Test Execution Commands

Once Node.js is upgraded to v20+:

```bash
# Run all system tests
bun run test:system

# Run specific feature
bunx cucumber-js path/to/feature.feature

# Run with specific profile
bunx cucumber-js --config cucumber.yml --profile ci

# Dry run to check step definitions
bun run cucumber:dry
```

    └── run-cucumber-with-bun.sh # Combined solution script
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Upgrade Node.js to v20 LTS**
   - This is the most straightforward solution
   - Ensures full Cucumber compatibility
   - No workarounds needed

2. **Implement Step Definitions**
   - Generated step definitions contain TODO placeholders
   - Need to port actual test logic from original `.stest.ts` files
   - Priority: Critical path features first

3. **Configure CI/CD**
   - Update CI pipelines to use Node.js v20
   - Configure Cucumber reporters for CI
   - Set up parallel execution for faster builds

### Future Improvements
1. Add Cucumber tags for better test organization
2. Implement shared step definitions library
3. Create custom reporters for better visibility
4. Add visual regression testing with Playwright
5. Integrate with test management tools

## Recommendations

1. **Priority 1**: Upgrade Node.js to v20 LTS immediately
2. **Priority 2**: Implement critical path step definitions
3. **Priority 3**: Set up CI/CD with new test structure
4. **Priority 4**: Train team on Cucumber/BDD best practices
